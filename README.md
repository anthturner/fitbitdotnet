============

FitBit Library for .NET Applications, Written in C# to support the Fitbit Ultra.

Note! This library is radically incomplete. If you're looking for something to develop
a production application with, please check out more complete projects like libfitbit.

To go along with the incompleteness, please excuse the lack of code structure in some
places. This is very much a work in progress and has a great deal of time and effort
left to go before it is even remotely useful.

Initial commit. Right now, we are able to communicate with the base station and open a
channel to the tracker unit. At the moment, there is a structure for the tracker unit's
information, but no means with which to retrieve it successfully.
